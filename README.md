# Applied AI for Neurology and Neurosciences

**Author:** Roberto Vargas Howell, MD – Neurologist & AI Innovator

This repository explores the integration of artificial intelligence with clinical neurology, focusing on the analysis, modeling, and simulation of brain networks. It combines medical expertise with advanced computational tools to develop applications that support diagnosis, monitoring, and research in neurological disorders.

## Objectives
- **Brain Network Analysis** – Use neuroimaging and electrophysiological data (EEG, MRI, fMRI, DTI) to map and interpret functional and structural connectivity.
- **Machine Learning Models** – Apply deep learning, graph neural networks, and statistical methods to detect patterns linked to epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases.
- **Clinical Decision Support** – Design AI-driven tools that assist healthcare professionals in making data-informed, patient-centered decisions.
- **Neuroinformatics & Data Integration** – Combine heterogeneous datasets (clinical records, imaging, genomics) to uncover novel biomarkers and personalized treatment strategies.
- **Ethics & Human-Centered AI** – Embed medical ethics, transparency, and patient privacy into every stage of development.

## Planned Projects
1. **Brain Network Visualization** – Interactive plots from open-access neuroimaging datasets.
2. **EEG Signal Classification** – Deep learning model to detect epileptiform activity.
3. **Neurology Knowledge Chatbot** – Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prototype for clinical education.
